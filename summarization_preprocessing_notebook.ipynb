The EEOC alleged that the defendants had violated the rights of female employees by subjecting them to sexual harassment in the workplace at the hands of their manager.  The EEOC also alleged that one of the complainants had been wrongfully fired for protesting against the sexual harassment.\\n\\nOn July 28, 2004, the parties filed a consent decree with the court.  Under the terms of the decree, the defendants were enjoined from discriminating or retaliating against any of their employees.  Defendants agreed to pay $243,000 in damages to the four complainants (including $33,000 in attorneys' fees), as well as $40,000 to eligible claimants, whose eligibility was to be determined by the EEOC.  Within 90 days of the consent decree, the defendants were to provide at least 2 hours of training to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace to all employees and managers at the Bel Air location of the business.  Defendants were to obtain prior approval from the EEOC of the material to be presented, and they had to provide the EEOC an attendance list for the training sessions within 10 days after the sessions were complete.  Every 90 days during the duration of the consent decree, the defendants were required to report to the EEOC any complaints of sexual harassment made as well as any remedial measures taken in response to such complaints.\\n\\n\",\n          \"The EEOC's Charlotte office, in conjunction with its Raleigh office, filed this suit on September 9, 2003 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, Southern Division. The complaint alleged that the defendant, M.D.P., INC., doing business as Pizza City USA, violated Title VII by requiring medical clearance for pregnant employees to work and by discharging complainant because of her pregnancy. The complaint also alleged that another female employee was fired in retaliation for complaining about a sexually hostile work environment.\\n\\nAfter the defendant answered the complaint, a trial date was set for November 8, 2004. On October 4, 2004, the parties notified the court that the case had settled. Subsequently, the parties filed a consent decree and a stipulation for dismissal. The case was dismissed without prejudice on December 8, 2004. The defendant agreed, through the consent decree, to pay the complainant $3,500, refrain from requiring medical clearance for pregnant employees, and provide Title VII training to its employees.\\n\\n\",\n          \"On February 15, 2012, a non-profit Catholic-based organization of priests united in ideology against the practice of abortion filed a U.S. District Court lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York against the Federal Government under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the First and Fifth Amendments.  Plaintiffs, represented by the American Freedom Law Center and private counsel, seek to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage.  Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their religious foundation.  \\n\\nOn May 14, 2012, the Priests amended their complaint raising the same issues but emphasizing that their health care plan is not a grandfather plan under the ACA and is therefore not entitled under the regulation to a temporary exemption from the mandate.\\n\\nOn September 12, 2012, the U.S. moved to dismiss the case, arguing that it was unripe, since the regulations were in the process of being amended; and on November 9, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction.  On December 21, the parties entered a stipulation, under which the U.S. would not enforce the contraception mandate at least through December 2013.  Plaintiff's counsel explained that the plaintiff was not, in its own view, entitled under the applicable regulations to a temporary exemption from the mandate; the U.S. argued otherwise, explaining that the plaintiff met the temporary enforcement safe harbor criteria. \\n\\nOn April 12, 2013, the District Court (Judge Frederic Bock) granted the Government's motion to dismiss because the Priests' claims were not yet ripe. The court found that that Government was in the process of amending the regulation. These amendments would take effect prior to the end of the safe harbor period such that the regulation in its current form would never be enforced against the Priests or similarly situated entities. And because the rules the contents of the new rules are yet to be determined, the Priests dissatisfaction with the new rules is purely speculative. The case was dismissed without prejudice.

The EEOC alleged that the defendants had violated the rights of female employees by subjecting them to sexual harassment in the workplace at the hands of their manager.  The EEOC also alleged that one of the complainants had been wrongfully fired for protesting against the sexual harassment.\\n\\nOn July 28, 2004, the parties filed a consent decree with the court.  Under the terms of the decree, the defendants were enjoined from discriminating or retaliating against any of their employees.  Defendants agreed to pay $243,000 in damages to the four complainants (including $33,000 in attorneys' fees), as well as $40,000 to eligible claimants, whose eligibility was to be determined by the EEOC.  Within 90 days of the consent decree, the defendants were to provide at least 2 hours of training to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace to all employees and managers at the Bel Air location of the business.  Defendants were to obtain prior approval from the EEOC of the material to be presented, and they had to provide the EEOC an attendance list for the training sessions within 10 days after the sessions were complete.  Every 90 days during the duration of the consent decree, the defendants were required to report to the EEOC any complaints of sexual harassment made as well as any remedial measures taken in response to such complaints.\\n\\n\",\n          \"The EEOC's Charlotte office, in conjunction with its Raleigh office, filed this suit on September 9, 2003 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, Southern Division. The complaint alleged that the defendant, M.D.P., INC., doing business as Pizza City USA, violated Title VII by requiring medical clearance for pregnant employees to work and by discharging complainant because of her pregnancy. The complaint also alleged that another female employee was fired in retaliation for complaining about a sexually hostile work environment.\\n\\nAfter the defendant answered the complaint, a trial date was set for November 8, 2004. On October 4, 2004, the parties notified the court that the case had settled. Subsequently, the parties filed a consent decree and a stipulation for dismissal. The case was dismissed without prejudice on December 8, 2004. The defendant agreed, through the consent decree, to pay the complainant $3,500, refrain from requiring medical clearance for pregnant employees, and provide Title VII training to its employees.\\n\\n\",\n          \"On February 15, 2012, a non-profit Catholic-based organization of priests united in ideology against the practice of abortion filed a U.S. District Court lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York against the Federal Government under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the First and Fifth Amendments.  Plaintiffs, represented by the American Freedom Law Center and private counsel, seek to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage.  Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their religious foundation.  \\n\\nOn May 14, 2012, the Priests amended their complaint raising the same issues but emphasizing that their health care plan is not a grandfather plan under the ACA and is therefore not entitled under the regulation to a temporary exemption from the mandate.\\n\\nOn September 12, 2012, the U.S. moved to dismiss the case, arguing that it was unripe, since the regulations were in the process of being amended; and on November 9, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction.  On December 21, the parties entered a stipulation, under which the U.S. would not enforce the contraception mandate at least through December 2013.  Plaintiff's counsel explained that the plaintiff was not, in its own view, entitled under the applicable regulations to a temporary exemption from the mandate; the U.S. argued otherwise, explaining that the plaintiff met the temporary enforcement safe harbor criteria. \\n\\nOn April 12, 2013, the District Court (Judge Frederic Bock) granted the Government's motion to dismiss because the Priests' claims were not yet ripe. The court found that that Government was in the process of amending the regulation. These amendments would take effect prior to the end of the safe harbor period such that the regulation in its current form would never be enforced against the Priests or similarly situated entities. And because the rules the contents of the new rules are yet to be determined, the Priests dissatisfaction with the new rules is purely speculative. The case was dismissed without prejudice.

The harassment included sexual comments and innuendos and unwelcome touching. Invoking the restaurant's sexual harassment policy, the charging parties complained to management 15 times over a 10-month period but the harassment continued. In retaliation for one of the CP's complaints about him, the assistant manager began to schedule her for work on days when she was unavailable. The CP complained but ultimately was terminated for failing to show up for her shift. Several months later, defendant terminated the assistant manager after the father of a 16-year-old female employee complained to management about the assistant manager putting his hands on her breasts and lifting her up.\\nBy a two-year consent decree, defendants are required to pay a total of $283,000 in monetary relief: $243,000 to the four charging parties and $40,000 to eligible claimants (female employees who were supervised and harassed by the assistant manager during the period March 2001 to January 2003) in amounts determined by the EEOC. Defendants are enjoined from sexually harassing or condoning the sexual harassment of its employees, including the use of derogatory comments or physical conduct, and from retaliation. Defendants' attorneys shall provide training on preventing workplace sexual harassment for all managers and employees at the Bel Air, Maryland location, including defendant's area director.\\n\\n6 February 2008 4:07 PM\",\n          \"SOUTHERN DIVISION\\n\\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n\\n)\\n\\nSEP 092003\\nBY' _ UO9A~D:u<\\n\\nCOMMISSION,\\n\\n)\\n\\nPlaintiff,\\n\\n) )\\n\\nCIVIL ACTION NO. ~l-O?J-VJ - \\\\5,3-~\\n\\n)\\n\\nv.\\n\\n)\\n\\n)\\n\\nCOMPLAINT\\n\\nM.D.P., INC. d/b/a PIZZA CITY USA\\n\\n)\\n\\nJURY TRIAL DEMAND\\n\\n)\\n\\nDefendant.\\n\\n)\\n\\n)\\n\\nNATURE OF THE ACTION\\nThis is an action under Title vn of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Title I of the Civil\\n\\nRights Act of 1991, to correct unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex, and to provide\\n\\nappropriate relief to Christi Smith and other similarly situated female employees who were\\n\\nadversely affected by the practices.

Frederic Block\\n\\nPlaintiff Priests for Life, by and through undersigned counsel, brings this First Amended Complaint against the above-named Defendants, their employees, agents, and successors in office, and in support thereof alleges the following upon information and belief:\\nINTRODUCTION 1. This is a civil action in which Plaintiff Priests for Life is seeking to protect and defend its fundamental rights to religious liberty and freedom of speech. Priests for Life is challenging certain implementing regulations of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\\\"Affordable Care Act\\\") which require it, as an employer, to provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 115\\ncounseling under penalty of federal law. This government mandate violates Priests for Life's rights to the free exercise of religion and the freedom of speech, it violates the Establishment Clause, and it deprives Priests for Life of the equal protection of the law in violation of the United States Constitution. The mandate also violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.\\n2. Priests for Life seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the challenged regulations and a declaration that these regulations violate federal constitutional and statutory law. The implementing regulations under the Affordable Care Act (i.e., the contraceptive services mandate), which require employers, including Priests for Life, to provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients and related education and counseling are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in that they violate Priests for Life's rights to the free exercise of religion and the freedom of speech under the First Amendment, they violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, they deprive Priests for Life of the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, they violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and they violate the Administrative Procedure Act.\\n3. The Affordable Care Act's contraception, sterilization, and abortifacient mandate violates the rights of Priests for Life as a Catholic organization. Indeed, the mandate violates the religious freedom of all people of faith, and even those of no faith, who have a conscientious objection to contraception, sterilization, or abortion. Priests for Life brings this action to vindicate not only its own rights and to remedy the harms it presently suffers and will continue to suffer absent the requested relief, but to ultimately protect the rights of all Americans who care about religious freedom, as well as to protect innocent human life.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 116\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. This action in which the United States is a defendant arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1331 and 1346. 5. Priests for Life's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, by 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000bb-1, and by the general legal and equitable powers of this Court. 6. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1391 because this is the judicial district in which Priests for Life is located.\\nPARTIES 7. Plaintiff Priests for Life is a non-profit corporation that is incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. It has its principal place of business in the County of Richmond, New York. And it is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a Section 501 organization. 8. Defendant Kathleen Sebelius is the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (hereinafter \\\"HHS\\\"). In this capacity, she has responsibility for the operation and management of HHS. Defendant Sebelius is sued in her official capacity only. 9. Defendant HHS is an executive agency of the United States government and is responsible for the promulgation, administration, and enforcement of the contraceptive services mandate, which is the subject of this lawsuit. 10. Defendant Hilda Solis is the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor. In this capacity, she has responsibility for the operation and management of the Department of Labor. Defendant Solis is sued in her official capacity only.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 117\\n11. Defendant Department of Labor is an executive agency of the United States government and is responsible for the promulgation, administration, and enforcement of the contraceptive services mandate, which is the subject of this lawsuit.\\n12. Defendant Timothy Geithner is the Secretary of the United States Department of the Treasury. In this capacity, he has responsibility for the operation and management of the Department of the Treasury. Defendant Geithner is sued in his official capacity only.\\n13. Defendant Department of the Treasury is an executive agency of the United States government and is responsible for the promulgation, administration, and enforcement of the contraceptive services mandate, which is the subject of this lawsuit.\\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS The Affordable Care Act\\n14. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 , amended by Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (hereinafter \\\"Affordable Care Act\\\" or \\\"Act\\\").\\n15. Among many other things, the Affordable Care Act requires certain employers to provide federal government-approved health insurance or pay a substantial per-employee fine. 26 U.S.C. \\u00a7 4980H.\\nThe Affordable Care Act - Not a General Law of Neutral Applicability 16. To date, HHS has granted over 1,000 individualized waiver requests from employers and to insurance plans excusing their compliance with the Affordable Care Act. 17. Certain provisions of the Act do not apply to members of certain religious groups. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. \\u00a7 5000A and (ii) (individual mandate does not apply to members\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 118\\nof a \\\"recognized religious sect or division\\\" that conscientiously objects to acceptance of public or private insurance funds); \\u00a7 5000A(ii) (individual mandate does not apply to members of \\\"health care sharing ministry\\\" that meets certain criteria). None of these exceptions apply to Priests for Life.\\n18. The Affordable Care Act's preventive care requirements (described below) do not apply to employers who provide so-called \\\"grandfathered\\\" health care plans. The Affordable Care Act's default position is that an existing health care plan is not a grandfathered plan.\\n19. Priests for Life's health care plan is not a grandfathered plan under the Affordable Care Act for multiple reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: the health care plan does not include the required \\\"disclosure of grandfather status\\\" statement; Priests for Life does not take the position that its health care plan is a grandfathered plan and thus does not maintain the records necessary to verify, explain, or clarify its status as a grandfathered plan nor will it make such records available for examination upon request; and the health care plan has an increase in a percentage cost-sharing requirement measured from 23 March 2010. See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 18011; 26 C.F.R. \\u00a7 54.9815-1251T; 29 C.F.R. \\u00a7 2590.715-1251; 45 C.F.R. \\u00a7 147.140.\\n20. The Affordable Care Act is not generally applicable because it does not apply equally to all individuals and employers; because the Act provides for numerous exemptions from its provisions, including exemptions for some religious groups and for some religious beliefs, but not for others, including Priests for Life and its religious beliefs; and because HHS grants individualized waiver requests excusing some employers from complying with the provisions of the Act.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 119\\n21. The Affordable Care is not neutral because some groups, both secular and religious, enjoy exemptions from certain provisions of the Act, which others do not; because some groups, both secular and religious, have received waivers from complying with the provisions of the Act, while others have not. Priests for Life is not eligible for any exemptions, and it is certainly not eligible for an exemption from the challenged mandate. In fact, the mandate specifically targets for discriminatory treatment those religious groups such as Priests for Life that oppose providing coverage for, or access to, \\\"contraceptive services\\\" on the basis of their religious views.\\n22. The Affordable Care Act favors certain religious organizations, beliefs, and practices, and it disfavors those religious organizations, such as Priests for Life, that oppose contraception, sterilization, and abortifacients on religious grounds. Thus, the Affordable Care Act discriminates amongst similarly situated religious organizations on the basis of religious beliefs and practices.\\nThe Affordable Care Act - Development of the Preventive Services Mandate 23. Among other things, one provision of the Affordable Care Act mandates that health insurers \\\"provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for . . . with respect to women, such additional preventative care and screenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.\\\" 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 300gg-13. 24. On 19 July 2010, HHS, along with the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury, published interim final regulations \\\"implementing the rules for group health plans and health insurance coverage in the group and individual markets under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act regarding preventive health services.\\\" 75 Fed. Reg.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 120\\n41726 . Among other things, the interim final regulations required health insurers to cover preventive care for women \\\"as provided for in guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.\\\" 75 Fed. Reg. 41759 .\\n25. HHS accepted public comments to the 2010 interim final regulations until 17 September 2010. Upon information and belief, a large number of groups filed comments, warning of the potential conscience implications of requiring religious individuals and groups to pay for certain kinds of services, including contraception, sterilization, and abortion.\\n26. HHS commissioned a study by a private health policy organization, the Institute of Medicine (hereinafter \\\"IOM\\\"), \\\"to review what preventive services are necessary for women's health and well-being and should be considered in the development of comprehensive guidelines for preventive services for women.\\\" (See\\n27. In conducting its study, IOM invited various pro-elective abortion groups and individuals to make presentations on the preventive care that should be provided by all health insurers, including the following: the Guttmacher Institute, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National Women's Law Center, the National Women's Health Network, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, John Santelli, and Sara Rosenbaum. (See\\n28. No religious groups or other groups that oppose government-mandated coverage of contraception, sterilization, abortion, and related education and counseling were among the invited presenters. (See\\n29. On 19 July 2011, IOM published a report of its study regarding preventive care for women. Among other things, IOM recommended that preventive services include \\\"[a]ll\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 121\\nFood and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods [and] sterilization procedures.\\\" (See Institute of Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps ).\\n30. Federal Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods include, among other drugs, devices and procedures, birth control pills, prescription contraceptive devices, Plan B (also known as the \\\"morning after pill\\\"), and ulipristal (also known as \\\"ella\\\" or the \\\"week after pill\\\").\\n31. Plan B and ella can prevent the implantation of a human embryo in the wall of the uterus and can cause the death of an embryo. The use of artificial means to prevent the implantation of a human embryo in the wall of the uterus or to cause the death of an embryo each constitute an \\\"abortion.\\\" Consequently, Plan B and ella are abortifacients.\\n32. On 1 August 2011, HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration (hereinafter \\\"HRSA\\\") announced that it was supporting \\\"the IOM's recommendations on preventive services that address health needs specific to women and fill gaps in existing guidelines.\\\" HRSA entitled the recommendations, \\\"Women's Preventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines.\\\" Among other things, HRSA's Guidelines include \\\"[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.\\\" (See\\nThe Affordable Care Act - Adoption of the Contraceptive Services Mandate 33. On 3 August 2011, HHS, along with the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury, published interim final regulations which, among other things, mandate that all health insurers \\\"provide benefits for and prohibit the imposition of cost-sharing: . . . . With respect to women, preventive care and screening provided for in comprehensive\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 122\\nguidelines supported by HRSA . . . which will be commonly known as HRSA's Women's Preventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines.\\\" 76 Fed. Reg. 46621 ; 45 C.F.R. \\u00a7 147.130.\\n34. Defendant Departments \\\"determined that an additional opportunity for public comment would be impractical and contrary to the public interest\\\" and promulgated the final regulation without waiting for public comment.\\n35. The 3 August 2011, interim final regulations noted that \\\"several commenters [to the 19 July 2010 interim final regulations] asserted that requiring group health plans sponsored by religious employers to cover contraceptive services that their faith deems contrary to its religious tenets would impinge upon their religious freedom.\\\" Accordingly, \\\"the Departments seek to provide for a religious accommodation that respects the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions. . . [T]he Departments are amending the interim final rules to provide HRSA additional discretion to exempt certain religious employees from the Guidelines where contraceptive services are concerned.\\\" (emphasis added).\\n36. For purposes of this discretionary exemption, a \\\"religious employer is one that: has the inculcation of religious values as its purpose; primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets; primarily serves persons who share its religious tenets; and is a non-profit organization under section 6033 and section 6033 or (iii).\\\" 76 Fed. Reg. 46621 ; 45 C.F.R. \\u00a7 147.130.\\n37. Priests for Life does not qualify as a \\\"religious employer\\\" for purposes of the discretionary exemption.\\n38. Although HHS accepted public comments to the 3 August 2011 interim final regulations until 30 September 2011, it went into effect immediately.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 123\\n39. Heath insurers are required to begin providing the coverage mandated by HRSA's Women's Preventive Care Guidelines in the first plan year (in the individual market, policy year) that begins on or after 1 August 2012.\\n40. Thus, by the stroke of a bureaucrat's pen, the federal government purported to effect a rule forcing private health plans nationwide to cover sterilization and contraception, including drugs that may cause abortion. All the other mandated \\\"preventive services\\\" prevent disease, but pregnancy is not a disease. Moreover, forcing plans to cover abortifacients violates existing federal conscience laws.\\n41. The contraceptive services component of the preventive services mandate imposes a substantial burden of unprecedented reach and severity on the consciences of those who consider such \\\"services\\\" immoral: insurers forced to write policies including this coverage; employers and schools forced to provide, sponsor, and subsidize the coverage; and individual employees and students forced to pay premiums for the coverage.\\n42. Upon information and belief, HHS received tens of thousands of comments objecting to the contraceptive services mandate.\\n43. The United States Council of Catholic Bishops called for a rescission of the contraceptive services mandate, and, in the event HHS insisted on keeping the mandate, urged HHS to provide a conscience exemption for all of these stakeholders-not just the extremely small subset of \\\"religious employers\\\" that HHS proposed to exempt initially.\\n44. On 20 January 2012, Defendant Sebelius announced that: \\\"Nonprofit employers who, based on religious beliefs do not currently provide contraceptive coverage in their insurance plan, will be provided an additional year, until 1 August 2013, to comply with the new law.\\\" She further announced that: \\\"We intend to require employers that do not offer coverage of\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 124\\ncontraceptive services to provide notice to employees, which will also state that contraceptive services are available at sites such as community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals with income-based support.\\\" (See\\n45. Notwithstanding HHS's stated intention to provide a one-year temporary enforcement safe harbor, the challenged mandate is currently federal law. There is no condition precedent necessary, nor is there any subsequent regulation required to make it so. In fact, when asked whether the temporary enforcement safe harbor was giving the Obama administration time to reconsider its position on the contraceptive services mandate or employers a year to comply, a senior administration official stated, without equivocation: \\\"It gives them [i.e., employers] a year to comply.\\\"\\n46. On 10 February 2012, President Obama announced that his Administration intends to propose and finalize a new regulation that \\\"will require insurance companies to cover contraception if the non-exempted religious organization chooses not to. . . . Contraception coverage will be offered to women by their employers' insurance companies directly, with no role for religious employers who oppose contraception.\\\" (See However, this so-called \\\"compromise,\\\" which is currently not the law and which was rejected by the Catholic Bishops because it fails to protect religious freedom and the right to conscience, is a distinction without a difference, and it does not remedy the constitutional and statutory defects of the challenged mandate.\\n47. While Defendant Sebelius claimed that women may pay up to $600 per year for contraceptive services, she asserted that insurers could provide those services to covered employees at no cost because \\\"on balance, preventive services around family planning, avoiding\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 125\\nwhat may be unhealthy pregnancies, avoiding the health consequences of that actually is a cost reducer.\\\" (See\\n48. Insurance companies do not donate products and services to covered employees. Drug makers will still charge insurers for birth control pills, IUD's, and other contraceptive devices. Doctors will still bill insurers for reproductive treatment. The reality, as with all mandated benefits, is that these costs will be borne eventually via higher premiums. Insurers may amortize the cost differently over time, but eventually prices will find equilibrium. Thus, Priests for Life will still pay for contraceptive services, including abortifacients, even if it is nominally carried by a third-party corporation-its health insurance provider. (See\\n49. There is no logical or moral distinction between the extant contraceptive services mandate, with its limited employer exemption, and the proposed \\\"revised\\\" regulation, which was announced on 10 February 2012. Employers who offer health insurance do not pay for individual benefits and products as they are provided. Rather, they pay a premium for a policy that gives their employees access to covered benefits and products when they need them. Under the proposed \\\"revised\\\" regulation, all non-exempted health plans must include contraceptive services among their covered benefits. Thus, religious employers will still be forced to provide their employees with access to a product that violates their religious convictions (i.e., contraceptives, sterilization, and abortifacients).\\n50. Defendants have rejected considering a \\\"broader exemption\\\" from the challenged mandate because they believe that such an exemption \\\"would lead to more employees having to pay out of pocket for contraceptive services, thus making it less likely that they would use contraceptives, which would undermine the benefits [of requiring the coverage].\\\" According to\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 126\\nDefendants, \\\"Employees that do not primarily employ employees who share the religious tenets of the organization are more likely to employ individuals who have no religious objection to the use of contraceptive services and therefore are more likely to use contraceptives. Including these employers within the scope of the exemption would subject their employees to the religious views of the employer, limiting access to contraceptives, thereby inhibiting the use of contraceptive services and the benefits of preventive care.\\\" 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8728 (Feb. 15, 2012) (emphasis added). Thus, the ultimate goal of Defendants is to increase the \\\"use of contraceptive services\\\" by compelling access to these services and to ensure that employees, including employees of religious organizations such as Priests for Life, are not \\\"subject\\\" to the employer's religious beliefs regarding such \\\"contraceptive services.\\\"\\n51. Consequently, despite beginning the process of amending the regulations by publishing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making in the Federal Register, see 77 Fed. Reg. 16501 (Mar. 21, 2012), Defendants have made it clear that they do not intend to provide a \\\"broader exemption\\\" that would in any way \\\"inhibit[] the use of contraceptive services\\\" by employees or subject . . . employees to the religious views of the employer.\\\" In short, Defendants do not intend to extend the exemption from the mandate to organizations such as Priests for Life in a manner that would protect and respect Priests for Life's religious beliefs and convictions.\\n52. Thus, the contraceptive services mandate of the Affordable Care Act favors certain religious organizations, beliefs, and practices, and it disfavors those religious organizations, such as Priests for Life, that oppose contraception, sterilization, and abortifacients on religious grounds. The contraceptive services mandate of the Affordable Care Act\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 127\\ndiscriminates amongst similarly situated religious organizations on the basis of religious beliefs and practices.\\n53. Through the contraceptive services mandate and its associated regulations, Defendants are conveying the message that those religious organizations that accept and promote the use of contraceptive services are favored members of the political community, while those religious organizations that oppose contraceptive services, such as Priests for Life, are disfavored members of the political community.\\nPriests for Life - Mission 54. Priests for Life was founded in 1991 to do one of the most important tasks in the Church today: to help priests around the world spread the Gospel of Life. The mission of Priests for Life is to unite and encourage all clergy to give special emphasis to the life issues in their ministry. It also seeks to help them take a more vocal and active role in the pro-life movement, with predominant emphasis on the issues of abortion and euthanasia. Priests for Life exists in order to show the clergy how to fight the culture of death. 55. Priests for Life's Mission Statement provides: \\\"As a Private Association of the Faithful, recognized and approved under the Canon Law of the Catholic Church, and working in harmony with the goals of the Bishops' Pro-Life Committee and the local diocesan respect life offices, Priests for Life seeks to:\\n1. unite, encourage, and provide ongoing training to priests and deacons who give a special emphasis to the 'life issues', especially abortion and euthanasia, in their ministries;\\n2. instill a sense of urgency in all clergy to teach about these issues and to mobilize their people to help stop abortion and euthanasia;\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 128\\n3. assist clergy and laity to work together productively for the cause of life; 4. provide ongoing training and motivation to the entire pro-life movement.\\\" 56. With the cooperation of bishops and their respect life offices, Priests for Life provides a bi-monthly newsletter to priests and deacons. This informative newsletter is also available to the general public. Priests for Life offers pro-life seminars and retreats to both clergy and laity of all denominations. With the permission of their respective ordinaries, the National Director of Priests for Life and his associates travel the country full time to meet with priests and pro-life groups. Priests for Life offers a wide range of audios, videos, and brochures, and regularly uses the media of television, radio, and the printed press to spread the message of life to all people of faith and to those of no faith. 57. Priests for Life also represents a family of ministries that reach and enrich every aspect of the pro-life movement, for clergy and laity alike, in a wide variety of activities, including direct ministries to priests, deacons, and seminarians; youth outreach; healing ministries; broadcasting; prayer campaigns; education regarding public policy; and facilitating relationships among pro-life organizations and leaders. 58. In short, Priests for Life provides a wide range of services to both Catholics and non-Catholics as part of its pro-life ministry. Priests for Life - Sincerely Held Religious Beliefs Regarding\\nContraceptive Practices and Abortion 59. A deep devotion to the Catholic faith is central to the mission of Priests for Life. 60. Priests for Life holds and actively professes religious beliefs that include traditional Christian teaching on the nature and purpose of human sexuality. In particular, in accordance with Pope Paul VI's 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae, Priests for Life believes that human sexuality has two primary purposes: to \\\"most closely unit[e] husband and wife\\\" and \\\"for\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 129\\nthe generation of new lives.\\\" Priests for Life believes and actively professes the Catholic Church teaching that \\\"[t]o use this divine gift destroying, even if only partially, its meaning and purpose is to contradict the nature both of man and of woman and of their most intimate relationship, and therefore it is to contradict also the plan of God and His Will.\\\" Therefore, Priests for Life believes and teaches that \\\"any action which either before, at the moment of, or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intended to prevent procreation, whether as an end or as a means\\\"- including contraception and sterilization-is a grave sin.\\n61. Priests for Life also holds and actively professes religious beliefs that include traditional Christian teaching on the sanctity of life. It believes and teaches that each human being bears the image and likeness of God, and therefore all human life is sacred and precious from the moment of conception. Consequently, Priests for Life believes and teaches that abortion ends a human life and is a grave sin.\\n62. Further, Priests for Life subscribes to authoritative Catholic teaching about the proper nature and aims of health care and medical treatment. For example, Priests for Life believes, in accordance with Pope John Paul II's 1995 encyclical Evangelium Vitae, that \\\"'[c]ausing death' can never be considered a form of medical treatment,\\\" but rather \\\"runs completely counter to the health-care profession, which is meant to be an impassioned and unflinching affirmation of life.\\\"\\n63. Based on the teachings of the Catholic Church, and its own sincerely held beliefs, Priests for Life does not believe that contraception, sterilization, or abortion are properly understood to constitute medicine, health care, or a means of providing for the well-being of persons. Indeed, Priests for Life believes these procedures involve gravely immoral practices.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 130\\nPriests for Life - Employee Health Insurance 64. As part of its commitment to Catholic social teaching, Priests for Life promotes the health and well-being of its employees. In furtherance of this commitment, Priests for Life provides health insurance for its employees. 65. Priests for Life cannot provide health insurance covering artificial contraception, sterilization, or abortion, or related education and counseling, without violating its sincerely held religious beliefs. 66. Priests for Life cannot provide health insurance that grants access to and makes available contraception, sterilization, or abortion, or related education and counseling, without violating its sincerely held religious beliefs. 67. Priests for Life cannot provide information or guidance to its employees about other locations at which they can access artificial contraception, sterilization, or abortion, or related education and counseling, without violating its sincerely held religious beliefs. 68. Priests for Life is funded solely through tax-deductible donations. Donors who give to Priests for Life do so with an understanding of Priest for Life's mission and with the assurance that Priests for Life will continue to adhere to, disseminate, and report reliable Catholic teaching on the sanctity of life and human sexuality. 69. Priests for Life cannot use donated funds for purposes known to be morally repugnant to its donors and in ways that would violate the implicit trust of the purpose of their donations. 70. Priests for Life's next plan year will commence in January 2013.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 131\\nPriests for Life - Harm Caused by the Imposition of the Challenged Mandate 71. Defendants claim that they are seeking \\\"to develop alternative ways of providing contraceptive coverage\\\" that would require \\\"contraceptive coverage directly to the employer's plan participants (and their beneficiaries) who desire it.\\\" Defendants contend that there would \\\"be no charge for the contraceptive coverage.\\\" 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8728 (Feb. 15, 2012). However, even under this proposed, but yet not the law, regulation, Priests for Life will still be purchasing a health care plan that provides \\\"contraceptive coverage directly to [its] plan participants (and their beneficiaries),\\\" which is unacceptable to Priests for Life. 72. Indeed, Priests for Life will still be paying for a health care plan that provides these immoral services \\\"directly to\\\" its employees in violation of Priests for Life's strongly held religious beliefs. And as Defendants' proposed regulations make plain, the government is inserting itself into Priests for Life's business practices so that, according to the government, Priests for Life's employees would not be \\\"subject\\\" to Priests for Life's \\\"religious views.\\\" Consequently, the federal government, through the mandate and its \\\"proposed\\\" regulations, are directly undermining and interfering with Priests for Life's religious beliefs and practices. 73. By providing its employees with a health care plan in general, the government mandate still forces Priests for Life to provide the mechanism by which contraception, sterilization, and abortifacients are provided to its employees, which is unacceptable to Priests for Life because it violates Priests for Life's sincerely held religious beliefs. 74. Because the enforcement penalties might apply in the future does not alter the fact that Priests for Life must now consider, plan for, and take actions to protect its religious freedoms from the proscriptions of the mandate and the proposed \\\"compromise\\\" mandate.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 132\\n75. Because of the government mandate, whether in its current or proposed form, Priests for Life must now make business decisions that will affect its ability to continue the services it provides. As a non-profit organization, Priests for Life funds its operations almost entirely through tax-deductible donations, including planned giving. Priests for Life must make business decisions now based on what it expects to receive in donations in the future. This requires Priests for Life to look several years ahead to determine what its budget will be and thus what services it will be capable of providing. Priests for Life's donors will not support an organization that provides its employees with access to contraception, sterilization, or abortifacients-practices that run counter to Priests for Life's mission and goals-the very basis for the donations in the first instance. Consequently, Priests for Life must now consider limiting the services it provides so as to save funding for the future if it were to comply with the mandate.\\n76. Indeed, the current mandate with its limited employer exemption and the proposed \\\"compromise\\\" will likely force Priests for Life out of the market for health care services and thus adversely affect it as an organization beyond any fines it may have to pay. Many of Priests for Life's valued employees, without whom Priests for Life could not provide its much needed services, will be forced to leave Priests for Life and seek other employment that provides health care benefits.\\n77. Priests for Life's decisions to forego certain spending today, so they will have the funds to cover their costs in the future are injuries fairly traceable to the challenged mandate. There is nothing improbable about the contention that the contraceptive services mandate is causing Priests for Life to feel economic and moral pressure today as a result of the government imposing substantial burdens on the religious beliefs and practices of Priests for Life.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 133\\n78. In sum, Priests for Life, a Catholic organization, is morally prohibited based on its sincerely held religious convictions from cooperating with evil. Priests for Life objects to being forced by the government to purchase a health care plan that provides its employees with access to contraceptives, sterilization, and abortifacients, all of which are prohibited by its religious convictions. This is true whether the immoral services are paid for directly, indirectly, or even not at all by Priests for Life. Contraception, sterilization, and abortifacients are immoral regardless of their cost. And Priests for Life objects to the government forcing it into a moral dilemma with regard to its relationship with its employees and its very survival as an effective, pro-life organization. In short, the harm caused to Priests for Life by the imposition of a government mandate to provide \\\"contraceptive services\\\" has come to pass. Priests for Life need not wait for the imposition of a penalty to seek relief from this Court.\\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Free Exercise of Religion - Violation of the First Amendment) 79. Priests for Life hereby incorporates by reference all stated paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 80. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling violates Priests for Life's right to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. 81. A government mandate, such as the proposed \\\"compromise\\\" regulation, that requires Priests for Life to provide access to contraception, sterilization, or abortion, and related education and counseling violates Priests for Life's right to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 134\\n82. Priests for Life's sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from providing insurance coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortion, and related education and counseling. Priests for Life's compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise.\\n83. Priests for Life's sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from providing access to contraception, sterilization, abortion, and related education and counseling. Priests for Life's compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise\\n84. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that Priests for Life provide health insurance that covers, or provides access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling substantially burdens Priests for Life's sincerely held religious beliefs.\\n85. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that Priests for Life provide health insurance that covers, or provides access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling chills Priests for Life's religious exercise.\\n86. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide health insurance that covers, or provides access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling creates government-imposed coercive pressure on Priests for Life to change or violate its sincerely held religious beliefs.\\n87. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide health insurance that covers, or provides access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling exposes Priests for Life to significant competitive disadvantage, in that it will no longer be able to offer its employees health insurance.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 135\\n88. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling does not further any compelling governmental interest.\\n89. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is not the least restrictive means to accomplish any permissible governmental interest.\\n90. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is a restriction on the free exercise of religion which is not narrowly tailored to advance any permissible governmental interest.\\n91. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide health insurance that covers, or provides access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling does not accommodate Priests for Life's sincerely held religious beliefs.\\n92. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is not a general law of neutral applicability.\\n93. Notwithstanding its receipt of multiple objections to the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling on the basis that it would violate sincerely held religious beliefs, Defendants designed that requirement and its\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 136\\n\\\"religious employer\\\" exemption in a way that makes it impossible for Priests for Life to comply with its religious beliefs.\\n94. By design, the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is imposed on some religious organizations, but not others, resulting in discrimination among religions.\\n95. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is official action that targets religious conduct and beliefs for distinctive and discriminatory adverse treatment.\\n96. Defendants promulgated the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling to suppress Priests for Life's and others' right to free exercise of religion.\\n97. The Affordable Care Act's violation of Priests for Life's right to free exercise of religion has caused, and will continue to cause, Priests for Life to suffer undue hardship and irreparable injury.\\n98. Priests for Life has no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of its constitutional rights.\\n99. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, Priests for Life has suffered immediate irreparable harm, including the loss of its constitutional rights, entitling Priests for Life to declaratory and injunctive relief.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 137\\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) 100. Priests for Life hereby incorporates by reference all stated paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 101. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000bb, et seq. 102. Priests for Life's sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from providing insurance coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortion, and related education and counseling. Priests for Life's compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise. 103. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that Priests for Life provide health insurance that covers, or provides access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling substantially burdens Priests for Life's sincerely held religious beliefs. 104. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling does not further any compelling governmental interest. 105. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is not the least restrictive means to accomplish any permissible governmental interest.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 138\\n106. The Affordable Care Act's violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has caused, and will continue to cause, Priests for Life to suffer undue hardship and irreparable injury.\\n107. Priests for Life has no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of its constitutional rights.\\n108. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Priests for Life has suffered immediate irreparable harm, entitling Priests for Life to declaratory and injunctive relief.\\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Freedom of Speech - Violation of the First Amendment) 109. Priests for Life hereby incorporates by reference all stated paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 110. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling violates Priests for Life's right to free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. 111. The HRSA Women's Preventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines mandate that non-exempt employer-sponsored health plans must cover \\\"preventive services,\\\" which include \\\"Contraceptive methods and counseling: All Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods; sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.\\\"\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 139\\n112. The Affordable Care Act's contraceptive services mandate compels Priests for Life to subsidize education and counseling regarding contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and abortifacient in violation of its sincerely held religious beliefs.\\n113. The Affordable Care Act's contraceptive services mandate compels Priests for Life to provide education and counseling regarding contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and abortifacients in violation of its sincerely held religious beliefs.\\n114. The Affordable Care Act's contraceptive services mandate compels Priests for Life to engage in speech that violates its sincerely held religious beliefs.\\n115. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is not narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest.\\n116. Defendants promulgated the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling to suppress Priests for Life's and others' right to free speech.\\n117. The Affordable Care Act's violation of Priests for Life's right to free speech has caused, and will continue to cause, Priests for Life to suffer undue hardship and irreparable injury.\\n118. Priests for Life has no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of its constitutional rights.\\n119. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, Priests for Life has suffered immediate irreparable harm,\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 140\\nincluding the loss of its constitutional rights, entitling Priests for Life to declaratory and injunctive relief.\\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Establishment Clause - Violation of the First Amendment) 120. Priests for Life hereby incorporates by reference all stated paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 121. By favoring some religious beliefs and practices, but disfavoring those sincerely held religious beliefs and practices of Priests for Life, Defendants have violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. 122. The challenged mandate lacks a secular purpose, has the primary effect of inhibiting religion, and creates excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. 123. Defendants' mandate is anti-Catholic, and it conveys an impermissible, government-sponsored message of disapproval of and hostility toward the Catholic Church and Catholic religious beliefs and practices. As a result, Defendants' contraceptive services mandate sends a clear message to Priests for Life and others who are adherents to the Catholic faith that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community and an accompanying message that those who oppose the Catholic Church and Catholic religious beliefs and practices by accepting and promoting contraceptive services, are insiders, favored members of the political community, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. 124. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, Priests for Life has suffered immediate irreparable harm,\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 141\\nincluding the loss of its constitutional rights, entitling Priests for Life to declaratory and injunctive relief.\\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Equal Protection - Violation of the Fifth Amendment) 125. Priests for Life hereby incorporates by reference all stated paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 126. By exempting some religious organizations from the proscriptions of the Affordable Care Act and its contraceptive services mandate on the basis of religious beliefs and practices, but forcing Priests for Life to provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling in violation of its sincerely held religious convictions, Defendants have deprived Priests for Life of the equal protection of the law guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 127. By favoring some religious beliefs and practices, but disfavoring those sincerely held religious beliefs and practices of Priests for Life, Defendants have deprived Priests for Life of the equal protection of the law guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 128. The contraceptive services mandate of the Affordable Care Act discriminates amongst similarly situated religious organizations on the basis of religious beliefs and practices in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 142\\n129. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' violation of the Fifth Amendment, Priests for Life has suffered immediate irreparable harm, including the loss of its constitutional rights, entitling Priests for Life to declaratory and injunctive relief.\\nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act) 130. Priests for Life hereby incorporates by reference all stated paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 131. Because the Affordable Care Act itself does not specify a standard for judicial review, it is subject to review under the default standard of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706. At issue in this lawsuit is whether adoption of the Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling was \\\"without observance of procedure required by law\\\" and/or \\\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\\\" 132. The Administrative Procedure Act requires general notice of a proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment before promulgation of a rulemaking, unless the agency, for good cause, finds that notice and public comment thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 551, et seq. 133. Defendant Departments purported to find good cause to forego public comment on the 3 August 2011, interim final regulations on the Affordable Care Act's preventive care mandate on the basis that the public had the opportunity to comment on the previous interim final rule issued on 19 July 2010. 76 Fed. Reg. 46621 .\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 143\\n134. The 19 July 2010, interim final rule, however, did not include HRSA's Women's Preventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines, which mandated the coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling. Accordingly, the public was deprived of the opportunity to comment on the contraceptive services mandate in the preventive services provision of the Affordable Care Act.\\n135. Because Defendant Departments took agency action \\\"not in observance of procedure required by law,\\\" Priests for Life is entitled to relief under 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706.\\n136. Similarly, Defendant Departments' decision to adopt the 3 August 2011, interim final regulations was made without considering the public's comments on the specific preventive procedures mandated therein, including coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling. Therefore, its action was \\\"arbitrary, capricious, [and] an abuse of discretion.\\\" Priests for Life is therefore also entitled to relief under 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706.\\n137. Section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act states that \\\"nothing in this title.e., Title I of the Act, which includes the provision dealing with \\\"preventive services be construed to require a qualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] services . . . as part of its essential health benefits for any plan year.\\\"\\n138. Further, the Weldon Amendment to the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009 prevents federal, state, and local governments from receiving certain federal funds if they discriminate against health care providers, including health insurance plans, that refuse to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions. Pub. L. 110 329, Div. A, Section 101 (Sept. 30, 2008) 122 Stat. 3574,\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 144\\n3575. This \\\"conscience clause\\\" is designed to prevent discrimination against health care providers who have a moral objection to abortion.\\n139. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling includes \\\"[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures.\\\"\\n140. Federal Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods include, among other drugs, devices and procedures, birth control pills, prescription contraceptive devices, Plan B (also known as the \\\"morning after pill\\\"), and ulipristal (also known as \\\"ella\\\" or the \\\"week after pill\\\").\\n141. Plan B and ella can prevent the implantation of a human embryo in the wall of the uterus and can cause the death of an embryo. The use of artificial means to prevent the implantation of a human embryo in the wall of the uterus or to cause the death of an embryo each constitute an \\\"abortion\\\" as that term is used in federal law. Consequently, Plan B and ella cause abortions.\\n142. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraceptives that cause abortions violates Section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act and the Weldon Amendment.\\n143. As set forth above, the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling violates the free exercise of religion and the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\\n\\nDocument 12 Filed 14 May 2012 PageID #: 145\\n144. Because the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is \\\"contrary to existing law,\\\" Priests for Life is further entitled to relief under 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706.\\n145. Priests for Life has no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of its constitutional and statutory rights.\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF Wherefore, Plaintiff Priests for Life prays for judgment as follows: A. That this Court declare that the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution; B.

This is a eivil action pursuant to which Plaintiff Priests fell\\u00b7 Life seeks a Preliminary and Permanent Injunetion, enjoining Defendants ii'om implementing and enfe)rcing provisions of the regulations promulgated under the \\\"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\\\" These regulations require employers to provide insurancc plans that include coverage for contraception, stcrilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling or incur\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 2\\nsubstantial penalty flnes. This mandate violates Priests fi)!' Life's rights to the fiee exercise of religion and the freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.\\n2. An actual controversy exists between Plaintiff Priests for Life and Defendants involving substantial Constitutional issues. Priests for Life asserts that provisions of the regulations promulgated under the \\\"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\\\" which require employers to provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling or incur substantial penalty fines are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in that they, among other things, violate Priests for Life's rights to the fi'ee exercise of religion and the freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. Defendants assert that these regulatory provisions comport with the Constitution, that no compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act is necessary, and that they are lawfully empowcred to cnforce and implement the subject regulations.\\n3. Consequently, PlaintitTPriests for Life also seeks a Declaratory Judgment that the regulations promulgated under the \\\"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\\\" (hereinafter \\\"Affordable Care Act\\\") requiring employers to provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related cducation and counseling or incur substantial penalty fInes violate Priests for Life's rights to the fi'ee exercise of religion and the fi'eedom of speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.\\n4. The AfTordable Care Act's contraception, sterilization, and abortifacient mandate violates the rights of Priests for Life as a Catholic organization. The mandate also violates the\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 3\\nfreedom of all people of faith, and even those of no hlith, who have a conscientious objection to contraception, sterilization, or abortion. Priests for Life brings this aetion to vindicate not only its own rights, but to protcct the rights of all Americans who care about our constitutional guarantees of the li\\\"ee exercise of religion and the li\\\"eedom of speech, as well as thc protection of innocent human life.\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE 5.

Jurisdiction is eonferred on this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.c. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1331 and 1346. 6.

In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the \\\"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\\\" (Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (20 10), {(mended by I-lealthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 ) (hereinafter \\\"Affordable Care Act\\\" or \\\"Act\\\").\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 5\\n16, Among many other things, the Affordable Care Act requires employers with more than 50 employees to provide federal government-approved health insurance or pay a substantial per-employee fine, (26 U,S,c' \\u00a7 4980B,)\\nThe Affordable Care Act - Not a Gcncral Law of Neutral Applicability 17, To date, HHS has granted over 1,000 individualized waiver requests hom employers and to insurance plans excusing their compliance with the Affordable Care Act. 18, The fine for failurc to offcr an approved health insurance plan docs not apply to employers with fewcr than 50 employees, not counting seasonal workers, (26 U.S,c' \\u00a7 4980H), 19, Certain provisions of the Act do not apply to mcmbers of certain religious groups, (See, e,g\\\" 26 US,c' \\u00a7 5000A and (ii) [individualmandatc docs not apply to members of a \\\"rccognized religious sect or division\\\" that conscientiously objccts to acceptance of public or private insurance funds); \\u00a7 5000A(ii) [individual mandate docs not apply to members of \\\"health care sharing ministry\\\" that meets certain criteria,]), None of these exceptions apply to Priests for Life, 20, The Affordable Care Act's preventive care rcquircmcnts (described below) do not apply to employers who provide so-called \\\"grand fathered\\\" health care plans, 21, The Affordable Care Act is not generally applicable because it docs not apply equally to all individuals and employers; because the Act provides for numerous exemptions ii'om its provisions; and because j\\u00b7ll\\u00b7IS grants individualized waiver requests excusing some employers from complying with the provisions of the Act. 22, The Affordable Care is not neutral because some groups, both secular and religious, enjoy exemptions !i'om certain provisions of the Act, which others do not; because\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 6\\nsome groups, both secular and religious, have reccived WaIvers li'OJ11 complying with the provisions of the Act, whilc others have not.\\nThe Affordable Care Act - Devclopmcnt of the Preventive Services Mandate 23. Among other things, one provision of the Affordable Care Act mandates that health insurers \\\"provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for . with respect to women, such additional prevcntative care and screcnings . as provided i(lr in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.\\\" (42 U.S.c. \\u00a7 300gg-1 3). 24. On 19 July 2025, l-J]-IS, along with the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury, published interim IInal regulations \\\"implementing the rules for group health plans and health insurance covcragc in thc group and individual markets under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act regarding preventive health services.\\\" (75 Fed. Reg. 41726 ). Among other things, tbc interim IInal regulations rcquircd health insurcrs to cover preventive care for womcn \\\"as provided for in guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.\\\" (75 FecI. Reg. 41759 ). 25. HHS accepted public comments to the 2010 interim fInal regulations until 17 September 2025. Upon information and bc1ict~ a large number of groups filed comments, warning of the potential conscience implications of requiring religious individuals and groups to pay for certain kinds of services, including contraception, sterilization, and abortion. 26. I-ll-IS commissioned a study by a private health policy organization, the Institute of Medicine (hereinafter \\\"10M\\\"), \\\"to review what preventive services are necessary for women's health and well-being and should be considered in the development of comprehensive guidelines for preventive services for women.\\\" (See hltp:llwww.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines).\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 7\\n27. In conducting its study, 10M invited the various pro-elective abortion groups and individuals to make presentations on the preventive care that should be provided by all health insurers, including the following: the Gu11macher Institute, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National Women's Law Center, the National Women's Health Network, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, John Santelli, and Sara Rosenbaum. (See h11p.nap.edu/openbook.php?record id= 13181 &page=217).\\n28. No religious groups or other groups that oppose governmcnt-mandated covcrage of contraception, sterilization, abortion, and related education and counseling were among the invited presenters. (See id= 13181 &pagc=217).\\n29. On 19 July 2011, 10M published a report of its study regarding preventive care for women. Among other things, 10M recommended that preventive services include \\\"[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods [and] sterilization procedures.\\\" (See Institute of Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps ).\\n30. Federal Drug Administration-approved contraccptive methods include, among other drugs, devices and procedures, birth control pills, prescription contraceptive devices, Plan B (also known as the \\\"morning atter pill\\\"), and ulipristal (also known as \\\"ella\\\" or the \\\"week afier pill\\\").\\n31. Plan B and ella can prevcnt the implantation of a human embryo in the wall of the uterus and can cause the death of an emblYo. The use of artificial means to prevent the implantation of a human embryo in the wall of the uterus or to cause the death of an embryo each constitute an \\\"abortion\\\" as that term is used in federal law. Consequently, Plan B and ella arc abortifacients.\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 8\\n32. On 1 August 2011, HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration (hereinafter \\\"HRSA\\\") announced that it was supporting \\\"the 10M's recommendations on preventive servIces that address health needs specific to women and Ell gaps in existing guidelines.\\\" HRSA entitled the recommendations \\\"Women's Preventive Serviccs: Requircd Health Plan Covcrage Guidelines.\\\" Among other things, HRSA's Guidelines inelude \\\"[a]l1 Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all womcn with reproductive capacity.\\\" (See http .hrsa. gov/womensguidelines).\\nThe Affordable Care Act - Adoption of the Contraceptive Services Mandate 33. On August 3, 201 I, HHS, along with the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury published interim final regulations which, among other things, mandate that all health insurers \\\"provide benefits for and prohibit the imposition of cost-sharing: . . . . With respect to women, preventive eare and screening provided for in comprehcnsive guidelines supported by I-IRSA . . . which will be commonly known as HRSA's Women's Preventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines.\\\" (76 Fed. Reg. 46621 (20 II); 45 C.F.R. \\u00a7 147.130). 34. Defendant Depar\\\"lments \\\"determined that an additional opportunity fbr public comment would be impractical and contrary to the public interest\\\" and promulgated the fInal regulation without waiting It)r public comment. 35. The 3 August 2011, interim final regulations noted that \\\"scveral commentcrs [to the 19 July 2025 interim final regulations] asserted that requiring group health plans sponsored by religious employers to covcr contraceptive services that their faith deems contrary to its religious tenets would impinge upon their religious fi\\u00b7eedol11.\\\" Accordingly, \\\"the Departments\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 9\\nseek to prove for a religious accommodation that respccts the uniquc relationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministcrial positions. . [T]he Dcpartmcnts are amending the interim final rules to provide HRSA additional discretion to exempt certain religious employees li'Ol11 the Guidclines wherc contraceptive services are concerned.\\\" (emphasis added).\\n36. For purposes of this discretionary excmption, a \\\"religious employer is one thal: Has the inculcation of religious values as its purpose; primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets; primarily serves persons who share its religious tenets; and is a non-proJ1t organization under section 6033 and section 6033 or (iii).\\\" (76 FecI. Reg. 46621 ; 45 C.F.R. \\u00a7 147.130).\\n37. Priests for Life does not qualify as a \\\"religious employer\\\" for purposes of the discretionary exemption.\\n38. Although HI-IS accepted public comments to the 20 II interim final regnlations until Septcmber 30, 20 II, it went into efrect immediately.\\n39. Heath insurers are required to begin providing the coverage mandated by HRSA's Women's Preventive Care Guidelines in the first plan year (in the individual market, policy year) that begins on or after August I, 2012.\\n40. Thus, by the stroke of a bureauerat's pen, the federal government purported to elfect a rule forcing private health plans nationwide to cover sterilization and contraception, including drugs that may cause abortion. All the other mandated \\\"preventive services\\\" prevent disease, but pregnancy is not a diseasc. Moreover, forcing plans to cover abortifacients violates existing federal conscience laws.\\n41. The contraeeptive servlCCS eomponent of the preventive servIces mandate imposes a substantial burden oj' unprecedented reach and severity on the consciences of those\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 10\\nwho consider such \\\"serviccs\\\" immoral: insurers forced to write policies including this coverage; employers and schools forced to sponsor and subsidize the coverage; and individual employees and students forced to pay premiums for the coverage.\\n42. Upon information and belief; I-JHS received tcns of thousands of comments objecting to the mandate regarding the provision of contraception, sterilization, and abortifacients.\\n43. The United States Council of Catholic Bishops called for a rescISSIOn of the contraceptive mandate, and, in the event HHS insisted on keeping the mandate, urged I-II-IS to provide a conscience exemption for all of these stakeholders-not just the extremely small subset of \\\"religious employers\\\" that HHS proposed to exempt initially.\\n44. On January 20, 20 I0, Defendant Sebelius announced that: \\\"Nonprofit employers who, based on religious beliefs do not currently provide contraceptive coverage in their insurance plan, will be provided an additional year, until August I, 2013, to comply with the new law.\\\" She further announced that: \\\"We intend to require employers that do not olTer coverage of contraceptive services to provide notice to employees, which will also state that contraceptive serviccs are available at sites such as community health ccntcrs, public clinics, and hospitals with income-based support.\\\" (See\\n45. To date, HHS has not promulgated any rule or regulation implcmenting cither the one-year extension or the compelled speech requirement.\\n46. On February 10, 20 II, President Obama announced that his Administration intends to propose and finalizc a ncw rcgulation that \\\"will requirc insurance companics to cover contraception if the non-exempted rcligious organization chooses not to. Contraception coverage will be olTered to women by their employers' insurance companies directly, with no\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 11\\nrole for religious employers who oppose contraception.\\\" (See 012/021 IO/fact-sheet-women-s-preventive-serviees-and-reI igious-institutions).\\n47. While Defendant Sebelius claimed that women may pay up to $600 per year for contraceptive services, she asscrted that insurers could providc those services to covered employees at no cost because \\\"on balance, prcventive services around family planning, avoiding what may be unhealthy pregnancies, avoiding the health consequences of that actually is a cost reducer.\\\" (See\\n48. Insurance companies do not donate products and services to covered employees. Drug makers will still charge insurers for birth control pills, IUD's, and other contraceptive devices. Doctors will still bill insurers for reproductive treatment. The reality, as with all mandated benelits, is that these costs will be borne eventually via higher premiums. Insurers may amortize the cost differently over time, but eventually prices will find an equilibrium. Priests for Life will still pay for contraceptive services, including abortifacients, even if it is nominally carried by a third-party corporation. (See I000 142405297020364600457721 5 I500682 I5494.hll11l).\\n49. There is no logical or 1110ral distinction betwcen the original contraceptive services mandate and the \\\"revised\\\" regulation announced on 10 February 2025. Employers who offcr health insurance do not pay for individual benefits and products as they arc provided. Rather, they pay a premium for a policy that gives their employees access to covered benefits and products when they need them. Under the \\\"rcvised\\\" rcgulation, all non-exempted hcalth plans l11ust include contraceptive services among their covered benefits. The choice for religious employers is still between paying an insurer to provide their employees with access to a product\\nI I\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 12\\nthat violates their convictions (i.e., contraceptives, sterilization, and abortifacients) or paying a large annual fine to the federal government.\\nPriests for Life - Mission 50. Priests for Life was founded in 1991 to do one of the most important tasks in the Church today: to help priests around the world spread the Gospel of Life to their people. The mission of Priests for Life is to unite and encourage all clergy to give special emphasis to the life issues in their ministry. It also seeks to help them take a more vocal and active role in the prolife movement, with predominant emphasis on the issues of abortion and euthanasia. Priests fCl!\\u00b7 Life exists in order to show the clergy how to fight the culture of death. 51. Priests for Life's Mission Statement provides: \\\"As a Private Association of the Faithful, recognized and approved under the Canon Law of the Catholic Church, and working in harmony with the goals of the Bishops' Pro-Life Committee and the local diocesan respect life offIces, Priests for Life seeks to:\\n1. unite, encourage, and provide ongoing training to priests and deacons who give a special emphasis to the 'life issues', especially abortion and euthanasia, in their 111inistries;\\n2. instill a sense of urgency in all clergy to teach about these issues and to mobilize their people to help stop abortion and euthanasia;\\n3. assist clergy and laity to work together productively fClr the cause oflife; 4. provide ongoing training and motivation to the entire pro-life movement.\\\" 52. With the co-operation of bishops and their respect life ofi1ees, Priests for Life provides a bi-monthly newsletter to priests and deacons. This inf(mnative newsletter is also available to the general public. Priests for Life offers pro-life seminars and retreats to both\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 13\\nclergy and laity.

A deep devotion to the Catholic faith is central to the mission of Priests for Life. 55. Priests for Life holds and actively professes rcligious belicfs that include traditional Christian teaching on the nature and purpose of human sexuality. In particular, in accordance with Pope Paul VI's 1968 encyclical Humallae Vitae, Pricsts fix Life believes that\\nhuman sexuality has two primary purposes: to \\\"most closely unit[e1husband and wifc\\\" and \\\"for\\nthe generation of new lives.\\\" Priests for Lifc believcs and actively professes the Catholic Church teaching that \\\"0 use this divine gin dcstroying, even if only partially, its meaning and purpose is to contradict the naturc both of man and of woman and of their most intimate relationship, and therei()re it is to contradict also the plan of God and His Will.\\\" Therefore, Priests for Life believes and teaches that \\\"any action which either bet()re, at the moment of; or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intcnded to prevent procreation, whether as an end or as a means\\\" including contraception and stcrilization a grave sin.\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 14\\n56. Priests for Life also holds and actively professes religious beliefs that include traditional Christian teaching on the sanctity of life. It believes and tcaches that each human being bears the image and likeness of God, and therefore all human lifc is sacred and prccious hom the moment of conception. Conscquently, Priests it)r Life believes and teaches that abortion ends a human life and is a grave sin.\\n57. Further, Priests for Life subscribes to authoritative Catholic teaching about the proper nature and aims of health care and medical treatment. For example, Priests it)r Life believes, in accordance with Pope John Paul II's 1995 encyclical Evongelium Vitae, that '\\\" [clausing death' can never be considered a form of medical treatment,\\\" but rather \\\"runs completely counter to the health-care profession, which is meant to be an impassioned and unflinching affirmation of life.\\\"\\n58. Based on the teachings of the Catholic Church, and its own deeply held beliefs, Priests for Life does not believe that contraception, sterilization, or abortion arc properly understood to constitute medicine, health care, or a means of providing for the well-being of persons. Indeed, Priests for Life believes these procedures involve gravely immoral practices.\\nPriests for Live - Employee Health Insurance 59. Priests for Life has approximately 50 to 60 employees. 60. As part of its commitment to Catholic social teaching, Priests for Life promotes the health and well-being of its employees. In furtherance of this commitment, Priests for Life provides health insurance for its employees. 61.

Priests l()]' Life cannot provide inl()j'jnation or guidance to its cmployees about othcr locations at which thcy can access artificial contraception, sterilization, or abortion, or related education and counseling, without violating its deeply held religious beliefs.\\n64.

Donors who give to Priests for Life do so with an understanding of Priest for Life's mission and with the assurance that Priests f()]' Life will continue to adhere to, disseminate, and report reliable Catholic teaching on the sanctity oflife and human sexuality.\\n65.

By design, the Affordable Care Act's requirement that cmploycrs provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is imposed on some religious organizations, but not others, resulting in discrimination among religions.\\n83. The Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling is official action that targets religious conduct and beliefs for distinctive and discriminatory adverse treatment.\\n84. Defendants promulgated the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling in order to suppress Priests for Life's and others' right to free exercise of religion.\\n85. The Allordable Care Act's violation of Priests lor Life'S right of (i'ee exercise of religion has caused, and will continue to cause, Priests for Life to suffer unduc hardship and irreparable injury.\\n86.

The Afi(mlable Care Act's contraception coverage mandate compels Priests for Life to subsidize education and counseling regarding contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and abortifacients. 99.

Priests for Lile hereby incorporates by referencc all stated paragraphs as though fully set tenth herein. 106. Because the Affordable Care Act itself does not specify a standard for judicial revicw, it is subjcct to review under the default standard of the Administrative Procedure Act. (5 U.S.c. \\u00a7 706). At issue in this lawsuit is whether adoption of the Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage Jell' contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling or incur substantial penalty fines was \\\"without observance of procedure required by law\\\" and/or \\\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discrction, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\\\"\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 22\\n107. The Administrative Procedure Act reqUIres general notice of a proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment before promUlgation of a rulemaking, unless the agency, for good cause, Ends that notice and public comment thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. (5 U.S.c. \\u00a7 551, et seq.).\\nlOS. Defendant Departments purported to find good cause to f(ll'ego public comment on the 3 August 2011, intcrim Enal regulations on the Affordablc Carc Aet's preventive eare mandate on the basis that the public had the opportunity to comment on the previous interim\\n\\u00bb. final rule issued on 19 July 2010. (76 Fed. Reg. 46621 (20 II\\n109. The July 19, 20 I0, interim final rule, however, did not include HRSA's Women's Preventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines, which mandated the coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling. Accordingly, the public was deprived of the opportunity to comment on the contraception mandate in the preventive services provision of the Affordable Care Act.\\n110. Because Defendant Departments took agency action \\\"not 111 observance of procedure required by law,\\\" Priests for Life is entitlcd to relief under 5 U.S.c. \\u00a7 706.\\nIll. Similarly, Defendant Departments' decision to adopt the 3 August 2011, interim final regulations was made without considering the public's comments on the specific preventive procedures mandated therein, including coverage for contraecption, sterilization, abortiLlcicnts, and related education and counseling. Therefore, its action was \\\"arbitrmy, capricious, [and] an abuse of discrction.\\\" Priests fClr Life is thereforc also entitled to relief under 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706.\\n112. Section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act states that \\\"nothing in this title\\\"~ (i.e., Title 1 of the Act, whieh includes the provision dealing with \\\"preventive\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 23\\nserviees be construed to reqUIre a qualifled health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] services . as part of its essential health bencflts for any plan year.\\\"\\n113. Further, the Weldon Amendment to the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistancc, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009 prevcnts federal, state, and local governments from receiving certain federal funds if they discriminate against health care providers, including health insurance plans, that refuse to provide, pay for, provide coverage ot~ or refer for abortions. (Pub. L. 110329, Div. A, Section 101 (Sept. 30,2008) 122 Stat. 3574, 3575). This \\\"conscience clause\\\" is designed to prevent discrimination against health care providers who have a moral objection to abOliion.\\n114. The Affordable Care Act's requircment that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and relatcd education and counseling includes \\\"[alll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures.\\\"\\n115. Federal Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods include, among other drugs, devices and procedures, birth control pills, prescription contraceptive devices, Plan B (also known as the \\\"morning after pill\\\"), and ulipristal (also known as \\\"ella\\\" or the \\\"week after pill\\\").\\n116. Plan B and ella can prevent the implantation of a human embryo in the wall of the uterus and can cause the death of an cmbryo. The usc of artificial means to prevent the implantation of a human cmbryo in the wall of the uterus or to cause the death of an embryo each constitutc an \\\"abortion\\\" as that term is uscd in fedcral law. Consequently, Plan B and ella cause abortions.\\n\\nDocument 1 Filed 15 February 2012 PageID #: 24\\n117. The Affordable Care Act's rcquirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraceptives that cause abortions violates Section 1303 of thc Affordable Care Act and the Weldon Amendment.\\n118. As set forth above, the Af10rdable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that includc coverage for contraccption, sterilization, abortif~leients, and related education and counseling or incur substantial penalty fines violates the fi\\\"cc exercise of religion and thc fi\\u00b7ce spceeh guarantees of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\\n119. Because the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortif~lcicnts, and related education and counseling or pay substantial penalty fines is \\\"contrary to existing law,\\\" Priests for Life is further entitled to relief under 5 U.S.c. \\u00a7 706.\\n120. Priests for Life has no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of its constitutional and statutory rights.\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF Whcrclc)rc, Plaintiff Priests f<)1\\\" Life prays for judgment as follows: A. That this Court declare that the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide insurance plans that include coverage for contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling or incur substantial penalty flnes violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; B.

American Freedom Law Center P.O. Box 131098 Ann Arbor, MI 48113\\n\\nFor Defendants: MICHELLE BENNETT, ESQ. United States Department of Justice Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch 20 Massachusetts Avenue NW Washington, DC 20001\\n\\nBLOCK, Senior District Judge: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \\\"ACA\\\") requires group\\nhealth insurance plans to provide coverage for certain preventive medical services without cost sharing. See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 300gg-13. Implementing regulations require contraception, sterilization, and abortifacients to be covered as part of preventive services, though the\\n\\nregulations exempt certain employers.1 Plaintiff Priests for Life, a non-profit Catholic\\norganization, contends that it cannot comply with the contraceptive-coverage mandate\\nwithout violating its religious beliefs and that the mandate violates the Establishment, Free\\nExercise, and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment; the Equal Protection Clause of the\\nFifth Amendment; the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; and the Administrative Procedure\\nAct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\\nProcedure 12 on the grounds that Priests for Life lacks standing and that the case is not\\nripe for judicial review. Priests for Life has moved for a temporary restraining order (\\\"TRO\\\")\\nand a preliminary injunction.2 The Court concludes that the claims are not ripe, and\\naccordingly grants defendants' motion and denies plaintiff's motion for lack of jurisdiction.\\nRipeness \\\"is a justiciability doctrine designed to prevent courts, through\\navoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements\\nover administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until\\nan administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the\\nchallenging parties.\\\" Nat'l Park Hospitality Ass'n v. Dep't of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807-08\\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Dougherty v. Town of N. Hempstead Bd. of Zoning\\n1This action is one of many filed throughout the country by religiously affiliated institutions challenging the contraceptive-coverage mandate. Other courts have described the statutory and regulatory background in detail. See, e.g., Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sebelius, ---F. Supp. 2d.----, 2013 WL 1278956, at *2-6 (N.D. Ala. 2013).\\n2Because Priests for Life believed that it did not meet the criteria for the temporary enforcement safe harbor, the parties entered into a stipulation on 21 December 2012, that defendants would not seek to enforce the mandate against Priests for Life during the safe harbor period. The Court thus dismissed the TRO motion as moot.\\n\\nAppeals, 282 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir. 2002) (\\\"The ripeness requirement prevents a federal court from entangling itself in abstract disagreements over matters that are premature for review because the injury is merely speculative and may never occur, depending on the final administrative resolution.\\\") To assess both constitutional and prudential ripeness, courts must \\\"evaluate the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\\\" Nat'l Park Hospitality Ass'n, 537 U.S. at 808.\\nDefendants argue that this dispute is not ripe for adjudication because they are in the process of amending the challenged regulations to accommodate religious objections and they have repeatedly represented that they will never enforce the regulations in their current form against Priests for Life or similarly situated entities. Defendants recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (\\\"NPRM\\\") intended to address the concerns of religious organizations. See 78 Fed. Reg. 8456, 8459 (Feb. 6, 2013). The proposed rules \\\"establish accommodations for health coverage established or maintained by eligible organizations \\u2026 with religious objections to contraceptive coverage,\\\" and propose ways \\\"to provide women with contraceptive coverage without cost sharing and to protect eligible organizations from having to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage to which they object on religious grounds.\\\" 78 Fed. Reg. at 8459, 8462. Echoing defendants' earlier representations, the NRPM expresses defendants' intention to finalize the amendments before the end of the safe harbor period. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 8459. At oral argument, defendants reiterated their commitment to finalizing the new rules by August 2013.\\nThe Court finds that the issues raised by this case are not fit for judicial decision.\\n\\nAlthough the current regulations are published, defendants have repeatedly indicated their intent to amend them. Government agencies are presumed to act in good faith, and defendants have substantiated this presumption through the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the temporary enforcement safe harbor, the NPRM, the stipulation not to take any enforcement action against Priests for Life through 31 December 2013, and their representations to this Court. See Colo. Christian Univ. v. Sebelius, 11-cv-3350, 2013 WL 93188, at *5 (D. Colo. Jan. 7, 2013). The current regulations, which are not being enforced against Priests for Life and are being altered, are not truly final. See Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sebelius, ---F. Supp. 2d.----, 2013 WL 1278956, at *18 (N.D. Ala. 2013) (noting that the government's promises to finalize changes and forego enforcement, coupled with the NPRM, have \\\"transformed\\\" the \\\"fundamental nature\\\" of the mandate \\\"into that of a temporary rule\\\"). Adjudicating the current regulations would therefore be a waste of judicial resources. See Persico v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp. 2d ----, 2013 WL 228200, at *18 (W.D. Pa. 2013). \\\"[T]he fact that the agency is in the middle of a rulemaking process which might altogether alleviate the alleged harm, or at the very least narrow the issues involved, making the eventual resolution of the lawsuit better tailored and much more efficient\\\" strongly counsels this Court to defer review. Eternal Word Television Network, 2013 WL 1278956, at *18; see also Am. Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 683 F.3d 382, 388-89 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (finding a suit unripe where the agency's proposed rule change was \\\"a complete reversal of course . . . that, if adopted, would necessitate substantively different legal analysis and would likely moot the analysis we could undertake if deciding the case now\\\").\\nThe proposed regulations are not fit for review since they are still being formed.\\n\\nThe NPRM merely conveys the proposals, and the government has the opportunity to adjust them in response to comments it has received. Any challenge to the proposed rules involves contingent future events that may not occur at all-or at least not as presently anticipated. See Nebraska v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 877 F. Supp. 2d 777, 804 (D. Neb. 2012). Thus, \\\"any attempt by this Court to adjudicate possible future amendments to the Mandate would be too speculative to yield meaningful review.\\\" Persico, 2013 WL 228200, at *19.\\nThe Court further finds that any hardship to Priests for Life fails to outweigh the challenge's lack of fitness. Because the contents of the new rules are yet to be determined, Priests for Life's dissatisfaction with the new rules is speculative. Moreover, any harm stemming from the need to plan for the possibility of giving up its health insurance plan in 2014 or paying government fines does not constitute a sufficient hardship for ripeness purposes. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp. 2d ----, 2013 WL 687080, at *16 (N.D. Tex. 2013) (\\\"[T]he inability to prepare for contingencies is not a hardship that outweighs the unfitness for review of the issues in this case.\\\"); Nebraska, 877 F. Supp. 2d at 802. Indeed, if this hardship \\\"were sufficient to require judicial review of a proposed agency decision, the hardship prong would be effectively meaningless, as many organizations plan for the future continually.\\\" Criswell Coll. v. Sebelius, 13-cv-4409, at *12 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 9, 2013); see also Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 736 F.2d 747, 751 (D.C. Cir. 1984). If Priests for Life is not content with the ultimate regulations, it may renew its legal challenge at that point. See Zubik v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp. 2d ----, 2012 WL 5932977, at *9 (W.D. Pa. 2012).\\nPriests for Life's claims are therefore not ripe for adjudication.3 In so holding,\\n3Because the Court finds this action unripe, there is no need to address standing. 5\\n\\nthis Court joins the overwhelming majority of courts that have addressed similar challenges\\nto the contraceptive-coverage mandate by similarly situated plaintiffs.4\\nThe Court further finds that because this case is nonjusticiable the appropriate\\ncourse is to dismiss it. See Steel Co. v.
